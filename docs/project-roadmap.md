    - [x] Binary protocol for `fsWriteFile`
    - [x] Disk-backed buffering via `NamedTempFile`
    - [x] Optimized client-side transport for binary frames

### Phase 05: Write Operations
**Status: [IN PROGRESS]**
- [ ] Create file/directory
- [ ] Delete file/directory
- [ ] Move/rename operations
- [ ] Undo/history tracking

### Phase 06+: Advanced Features
**Status: [PLANNED]**

## Recent Milestones

- **2026-04-16:** Completed Phase 01: Multi-Server Auth Bypass.
    - ✅ Added `--no-auth` CLI flag for dev mode authentication bypass
    - ✅ Updated AppState with `no_auth: bool` field
    - ✅ Modified auth middleware, login handler, and status endpoint
    - ✅ Added production safety guards (panics if no_auth + MongoDB or prod env)
    - ✅ Created 7 integration tests (all passing)
    - ✅ Code reviewed: 9.5/10 (critical security issue resolved)
- **2026-04-14:** Implemented Binary Streaming for Large File Writes.
    - Switched `fsWriteFile` from base64 text frames to zero-overhead binary frames for large files.
    - Introduced `NamedTempFile` buffering on the server to prevent RAM spikes during large saves.
    - Updated `ws-transport.ts` to support the hybrid JSON+Binary protocol.
- **2026-04-09:** Completed Phase 04: Monaco Editor + Save.
- **2026-03-25:** Completed Phase 03: IDE Shell.
