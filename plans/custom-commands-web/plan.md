# Custom Commands in Web UI

## Summary

Custom commands (`project.commands`) are configurable in Settings but invisible and
unusable in the Projects pages. This plan wires the exec API to the web client, adds
a Commands tab to ProjectDetailPage, shows effective build/run commands, and allows
inline command management without navigating to Settings.

## Problem

1. Build/Run tabs show no command — users don't know what will execute
2. Custom commands defined in Settings have no execution UI
3. `POST /api/exec/:project` server endpoint exists but has no web client
4. No way to add/edit commands from ProjectDetailPage

## Phases

| Phase | Title | Status | Effort | Parallel Group | File |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|----------------|------|
| 01 | API Client + Hooks | pending | 0.5h | A | [phase-01](./phase-01-api-client-hooks.md) |
| 02 | Commands Tab in ProjectDetailPage | pending | 2h | A | [phase-02](./phase-02-commands-tab.md) |
| 03 | Build & Run Command Visibility | pending | 1.5h | A | [phase-03](./phase-03-build-run-visibility.md) |

## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 01 (API client + hooks)
    ↓
Phase 02 (Commands tab — consumes Phase 01 hooks)
Phase 03 (Build/Run visibility — consumes Phase 01 hooks)

Execution: Phase 01 first, then Phase 02 + 03 in parallel
```

## File Ownership Matrix

| File | Phase |
|------|-------|
| `packages/web/src/api/client.ts` | 01 |
| `packages/web/src/api/queries.ts` | 01 |
| `packages/web/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx` | 02 |
| `packages/web/src/components/organisms/CommandRunner.tsx` (new) | 02 |
| `packages/web/src/pages/BuildPage.tsx` | 03 |
| `packages/web/src/components/organisms/BuildLog.tsx` | 03 |

## Affected Packages

- `@dev-hub/web` — All changes are frontend-only

## No Server Changes Needed

The server already has:
- `POST /api/exec/:project` — executes custom commands
- `PATCH /api/config/projects/:name` — updates project config
- SSE `command:progress` events — real-time output streaming
- `PUT /api/config` — full config updates
